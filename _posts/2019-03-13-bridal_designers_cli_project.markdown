Starting this first project was terrifying. I started this bootcamp six months ago while I was still in Korea working full-time. So, a lot of the Ruby fundamentals were forgotten, and I was constantly searching on Google and YouTube for simple Ruby codes. I was already frustrated with myself and really nervous about starting this project.

What really helped me was talking to my educational coach, who consistently encouraged me even though my progress has been extremely slow, and my technical coach for this project, who was patient with me while I was struggling to remember what I learned in Ruby four months ago.

After my initial call with my tech coach, we found out that the website I chose to scrape had a small 404 error, so I was back to square one. I think this part was the hardest part of the project: choosing a website to scrape. Although my tech coach told me that scraping was NOT the main point of this project, to me it was. Not having a website was preventing me from even getting started, so it was very annoying. 

But while having lunch with my brother, he told me that local businesses usually have simple websites that might be easier and more accessible to scrape. That advice was perfect! I found a good simple website of a bridal shop in town and I was good to go!

# Getting Started
Of course, my excitement was short-lived because now I was sitting in front of a blank screen with no clue on how to start. I remembered the resources that my tech coach gave me and also all of the resources on the lesson page itself. I started reading through all of them, and here are the resources that helped me the most:
* **CLI Gem Walkthrough video for Daily Deals**: At first I was hesitant to watch the video because previously some of these tutorial videos were so noisy and disorganized that they confused me more than they helped me. Also this video is an hour long!! However I thought I'll give it a go and I'm glad I watched it now. It shows the process from start to finish and even goes through the thought process on forming this CLI from scratch. I would pause the video frequently as I coded along with it. 

* **World's Best Restaurants CLI**: This was an actual student's project so it was simple and easy to follow. I found myself comparing my codes with his to double check what I'm doing.

* **My codes for the previous labs**: I never thought I would look back at my labs' codes again (because I felt like they weren't good enough nor correct), but looking back at what I personally wrote helped me just as much as looking at other people's codes. Maybe it's because those codes reflect my thought process and I can remember it as I look through it, but my codes for the Student Scraper really helped me during this project.

# Writing the code I wish I had
One of the things that stuck with me throughout the CLI Gem Walkthrough video was the phrase, "Writing the code I wish I had". I never thought of it that way, but this really helped me start writing my codes more naturally.

So, in the video, Avi starts building the CLI part first using 'fake data' but anyway making the program work the way he wanted. I did the same, so I got my CLI to work first. That's different from how I remembered our labs worked so far in our curriculum. We usually had to code all the other parts first, get the tests running, and then we built the CLI last. But doing it this way made sense to me. 

# Getting Stuck
Getting started is always the hardest but getting stuck along the way is also just as frustrating. My biggest problem was that the website I decided to scrape was simple BUT the HTML was very inconsistent.

For example, let's say the name of the bridal designer was encapsulated within `<h2 class="gallery-title">` tags. And this was the case for almost all of the names. However somewhere in the middle, there was one name that was in `<div>` tags. Just randomly... for no reason... and that caused everything to break. Trying to find what was causing my program to break and then trying to fix it was incredibly hard.

I would never have gotten through these problems without the help of my tech coaches/section leads and fellow coders on Slack. In fact, this was the first time I logged into Slack and figured out how to use it.
Usually I just used the "Ask a Question" feature on the Learn website, but after being "rejected" a couple of times (because my question was a project question), I was forced to use Slack. But I'm so glad I did. I'll probably use Slack more often in the future.

# Fine-Tuning
I found the last part of this project to be almost fun. After getting the CLI up and running, it was time to fine-tune everything and make it more presentable. I tried entering random numbers and letters to see if it will cause any errors within the CLI. I played around with the formatting of how it will print onto the screen. This part was quite enjoyable.

# Wrapping Up
This project was challenging but the best learning experience I had so far in this curriculum. It forced me to remember all the Ruby basics while also learning new codes through Google. Building it from scratch was daunting but now that it's over with, I'm really proud of myself! Not because of any results from this project, but just the fact that I comprehended the material and was able to write and execute it.

I'm looking forward to the next section, which is on SQL. Since I won't be working full-time anymore, I can concentrate on my studies and actually retain the knowledge. I hope to quickly move through the curriculum and make up for lost time!
