> I think I'm going through a mid-30s life crisis.

I earned my Master's degree in International Educational Development. I have a passion to teach international students. More specifically, I want to equip students (both school-aged and adults) whose native language is not English with the ability to communicate and express their thoughts and ideas in English, so that they can branch out of their country and tap into the global market. Simply put, I teach English as a foreign or second language. 

But I did more than just teaching in a classroom. I've started a local summer camp for students in Raleigh. I ran an English camp for students from South Korea. And more recently, I was the principal of an international school in Cambodia. I loved my life as an educator and I can still say that there is no other career that will bring me more joy, satisfaction, and pride. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't working out financially, especially with student loan debt. My most recent job was teaching at a private school in South Korea. Every few months, whenever the exchange rate was low, I would wire money into my American bank account just to pay my monthly student loan payments. As I was doing this, I began to wonder, "How much longer can I keep this up?" 

Then I heard about coding bootcamps. I was a computer science major my first year in college and I remembered that I enjoyed my C++ class very much. I wondered if I can pick up coding again. I began to search online for coding bootcamps and came across Flatiron School. I started the free bootcamp prep and found myself remembering HTML fairly accurately. So, I thought, "Why not? Maybe I can do this."

I enrolled in the self-paced Full-Stack Web Development course at Flatiron School in August 2018. I was still teaching full-time in Korea. I started learning Ruby but found myself having time to study only on the weekends. And then when the semester became extremely busy in November and December, I had no time to study at all. Only when we I hit winter break did I have time to pick up my studies again. By then I was forgetting what I had learned and was struggling to make progress. I knew I couldn't continue studying like this. So, I quit my teaching job at the end of the school year (which ends in February in Korea) and came back home to the States.

Now I've been back home for a few weeks and I'm finally studying full-time. I reviewed the Ruby fundamentals and finished my first portfolio project. I'm so glad I'm studying full-time and I hope I can make up for lost time. And I truly hope that this will all be worth it in the end.
